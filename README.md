# Tavares Learning Notes

This Repository is only for notes of diverse topics I struggled a bit to understand.
The notes dont have a Pattern or layout, their main goal is to understand and sink the knowledge.

Resarching topics and explaining them to myself helps me to absorve the knowledge. And it's also a good reference to check if I ever forget about it or when I want to refresh my memory about it.

It also might help you to understand how I think when I'm coding.
